<strong>PORTLAND COMMITTEE FOR COMMUNITY-ENGAGED POLICING APPLICATION INFORMATION</strong>

<strong>What is the Portland Committee for Community-Engaged Policing?</strong>

The Portland Committee for Community-Engaged Policing (PCCEP) is being formed to independently assess the City of Portland’s Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in addition to working with the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) to develop policies and assess community engagement efforts. The Settlement Agreement calls for reform to PPB policies and training, particularly related to use of force and interactions with people who have or are perceived to have a mental health condition.
